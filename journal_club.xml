  <title>COADVISE: Covariate Adjustment with Variable Selection and Missing Data Imputation in Randomized Controlled Trials</title>
  <link>https://carswg.github.io/journalclub/journalclub10.html</link>

<p><strong>Topic:</strong> COADVISE: Covariate Adjustment with Variable Selection and Missing Data Imputation in Randomized Controlled Trials</p>
<p><strong>Datetime: March 14th Friday, 11am-12pm ET.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Presenter:</strong> Shu Yang and Yi Liu from North Carolina State University</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Adjusting for covariates in randomized controlled trials can enhance the credibility and efficiency of average treatment effect estimation. However, managing numerous covariates and their non-linear transformations is challenging, particularly when outcomes and covariates have missing data. In this tutorial, we propose a principled covariate adjustment framework, “COADVISE,” that enables (i) variable selection for covariates most relevant to the outcome, (ii) nonlinear adjustments, and (iii) robust imputation of missing data for both outcomes and covariates. This framework ensures consistent estimates with improved efficiency over unadjusted estimators and provides robust variance estimation, even under outcome model misspecification. We demonstrate efficiency gains through theoretical analysis and conduct extensive simulations to compare alternative variable selection strategies, offering cautionary recommendations. We showcase the framework’s practical utility by applying it to the Best Apnea Interventions for Research trial data from the National Sleep Research Resource. A user-friendly R package, Coadvise, facilitates implementation.</p>

  <title>Estimating the efficiency gain of covariate-adjusted analyses in future clinical trials using external data</title>
  <link>https://carswg.github.io/journalclub/journalclub9.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p><strong>Topic:</strong> Estimating the efficiency gain of covariate-adjusted analyses in future clinical trials using external data</p>
<p><strong>Datetime: February 14th 2025 Friday, 11am-12pm ET.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Presenter:</strong> Xiudi Li from University of California, Berkeley</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> We present a framework for using existing external data to identify and estimate the relative efficiency of a covariate-adjusted estimator compared to an unadjusted estimator in a future randomized trial. Under conditions, these relative efficiencies approximate the ratio of sample sizes needed to achieve a desired power. We develop semiparametrically efficient estimators of the relative efficiencies for several treatment effect estimands of interest with either fully or partially observed outcomes, allowing for the application of flexible statistical learning tools to estimate the nuisance functions. We propose an analytic Wald-type confidence interval and a double bootstrap scheme for statistical inference. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed methods through simulation studies and apply these methods to estimate the efficiency gain of covariate adjustment in Covid-19 therapeutic trials.</p>

  <title>RobinCar: An R Package for Robust Covariate Adjustment for Continuous, Discrete, and Time-to-Event Outcomes in Randomized Clinical Trials</title>
  <link>https://carswg.github.io/journalclub/journalclub8.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p><strong>Topic:</strong> RobinCar: An R Package for Robust Covariate Adjustment for Continuous, Discrete, and Time-to-Event Outcomes in Randomized Clinical Trials</p>
<p><strong>Datetime: December 13th Friday, 11am-12pm ET.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Presenter:</strong> Marlena Bannick from University of Washington</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Covariate adjustment is a powerful technique that can improve efficiency when estimating treatment effects in randomized clinical trials. We develop a one-stop and user-friendly R package called RobinCar that allows clinical researchers to conveniently and robustly apply covariate adjustment. RobinCar covers covariate adjustment using linear and non-linear working models, and covariate adjustment for time-to-event outcomes. The guiding principles of RobinCar are to provide users with methods that (1) target the same estimand as the unadjusted analysis, (2) do not make any model assumptions beyond what is assumed for an unadjusted analysis, and (3) have robust variance estimation. Importantly, RobinCar takes into account the randomization scheme when constructing the variance estimate (including simple, stratified permuted block, and Pocock and Simon’s minimization). In this talk, we will give an overview of RobinCar, which will include a tour of the functions, and a brief description of the methodologies behind each of the functions. We will also include a discussion of RobinCar2, which is currently being developed by the Software sub-team of the ASA-BIOP Covariate Adjustment Scientific Working Group. <strong>Recording:</strong></p>

  <title>Adjustments with Many Regressors under Covariate-Adaptive Randomizations</title>
  <link>https://carswg.github.io/journalclub/journalclub7.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p><strong>Topic:</strong> Adjustments with Many Regressors under Covariate-Adaptive Randomizations</p>
<p><strong>Datetime: November 8th Friday, 11am-12pm ET.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Presenter:</strong> Yichong Zhang from Singapore Management University</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Our paper discovers a new trade-off of using regression adjustments (RAs) in causal inference under covariate-adaptive randomizations (CARs). On one hand, RAs can improve the efficiency of causal estimators by incorporating information from covariates that are not used in the randomization. On the other hand, RAs can degrade estimation efficiency due to their estimation errors, which are not asymptotically negligible when the number of regressors is of the same order as the sample size. Ignoring the estimation errors of RAs may result in serious over- rejection of causal inference under the null hypothesis. To address the issue, we construct a new ATE estimator by optimally linearly combining the estimators with and without RAs. We then develop a unified inference theory for this estimator under CARs. It has two features: (1) the Wald test based on it achieves the exact asymptotic size under the null hypothesis, regardless of whether the number of covariates is fixed or diverges no faster than the sample size; and (2) it guarantees weak efficiency improvement over estimators both with and without RAs.</p>

  <title>Covariate-Adjusted Randomization Analyzed with Randomization-Based Inference</title>
  <link>https://carswg.github.io/journalclub/journalclub6.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p><strong>Topic:</strong> Covariate-Adjusted Randomization Analyzed with Randomization-Based Inference</p>
<p><strong>Datetime: Oct 11th Friday, 11am-12pm EDT.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Presenter:</strong> Jonathan Chipman from University of Utah</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Adjusting for covariates in the design and/or analysis can increase the efficiency of a randomized trial. While several model-based strategies for covariate adjustment have been developed—many of which can accommodate covariate-adjusted/adaptive randomization (CAR)—the potential benefits of CAR are less well understood, particularly regarding efficiency gains. Here, we examine the strengths and limitations of design-based covariate adjustment analyzed with randomization-based inference (i.e., CAR+RBI), review traditional and contemporary CAR methods, and provide a case study to assess the efficiency of CAR+RBI strategies. We ask the question: can adjusting for covariates only in the design be as powerful as adjusting for covariates only in the analysis?</p>
<p>The case study uses data from the REACH trial (n=512, 12-month continuous outcome with 9 baseline covariates explaining 32% of the outcome variance). We compare the power of CAR+RBI strategies to detect a beneficial treatment effect against that of complete randomization, analyzed with a comparable covariate-adjusted linear model. In this case study, biased-coin minimization CAR+RBI strategies were the most powerful strategies, suggesting that covariate adjustment in the design can be as effective as model-based covariate adjustment. While these findings are case-specific and results may differ across studies, they highlight the importance of further CAR and RBI research and consideration of implementation barriers.</p>

  <title>Automated, efficient and model-free inference for randomized clinical trials via data-driven covariate adjustment</title>
  <link>https://carswg.github.io/journalclub/journalclub5.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p><strong>Topic:</strong> Automated, efficient and model-free inference for randomized clinical trials via data-driven covariate adjustment</p>
<p><strong>Datetime: September 13th Friday, 11am-12pm EDT.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Presenter:</strong> Kelly Van Lancker from Ghent University</p>
<p><strong>Zoom link:</strong>: https://umich.zoom.us/j/7573650566</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> In May 2023, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) released guidance for industry on “Adjustment for Covariates in Randomized Clinical Trials for Drugs and Biological Products”. Covariate adjustment is a statistical analysis method for improving precision and power in clinical trials by adjusting for pre-specified, prognostic baseline variables. Though recommended by the FDA and the European Medicines Agency (EMA), many trials do not exploit the available information in baseline variables or make use only of the baseline measurement of the outcome. This is likely (partly) due to the regulatory mandate to pre-specify baseline covariates for adjustment, leading to challenges in determining appropriate covariates and their functional forms. We will explore the potential of automated data-adaptive methods, such as machine learning algorithms, for covariate adjustment, addressing the challenge of pre-specification. Specifically, our approach allows the use of complex models or machine learning algorithms without compromising the interpretation or validity of the treatment effect estimate and its corresponding standard error, even in the presence of misspecified outcome working models. This contrasts the majority of competing works which assume correct model specification for the validity of standard errors. Our proposed estimators either necessitate ultra-sparsity in the outcome model (which can be relaxed by limiting the number of predictors in the model) or necessitate integration with sample splitting to enhance their performance. As such, we will arrive at simple estimators and standard errors for the marginal treatment effect in randomized clinical trials, which exploit data-adaptive outcome predictions based on prognostic baseline covariates, and have low (or no) bias in finite samples even when those predictions are themselves biased.</p>

  <title>Strategies for Practical and Effective Covariate Adjustment of Continuous Outcomes</title>
  <link>https://carswg.github.io/journalclub/journalclub4.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p><strong>Topic:</strong> AStrategies for Practical and Effective Covariate Adjustment of Continuous Outcomes</p>
<p><strong>Datetime: June 14th Friday, 11am-12pm EDT.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Presenter:</strong> Michel Friesenhahn from Genentech</p>
<p><strong>Zoom link:</strong>: https://umich.zoom.us/j/7573650566</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> There has been considerable research that has put covariate adjustment on firm footing, even for use in the primary analysis of confirmatory clinical trials. Several of my colleagues and I saw there was a need to explain the insights generated from this research and to distill them into simple and practical suggestions for implementation. Our recommendations for continuous outcomes when primary interest is in unconditional treatment effect estimands, such as Average Treatment Effects (ATEs), are written up in blog form (https://stats4datascience.com/posts/covariate_adjustment/).</p>
<p>For this talk, I will discuss selected proposals from the blog that I think may be of particular interest to the working group, as well as potential areas for future work:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Performance metrics and their use in analyzing data external to a trial to select and/or construct covariates. In addition, I will discuss how these metrics provide insight into the impacts of Heterogeneous Treatment Effects (HTEs) and strategic implications for sample size determination.</p></li>
<li><p>The concept of a model budget and suggested rules of thumb to protect the validity of statistical inference when using covariate adjustment.</p></li>
<li><p>Suggestions for constructing the working regression model.</p></li>
<li><p>Accounting for stratified randomization.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, I will discuss covariate adjustment of longitudinal data with continuous outcomes.</p></li>
